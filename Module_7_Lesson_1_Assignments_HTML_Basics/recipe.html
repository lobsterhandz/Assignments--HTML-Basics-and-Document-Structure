    <h1>Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies (The Only Recipe You Need!)</h1>
    
    <!-- Task 1: Short paragraph description about the recipe -->
    <p>This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe will make your taste buds dance and your neighbors jealous. These chewy, delicious cookies are perfect for any occasion. Let's get started, cookie monsters!</p>
    
    <!-- Task 1: Unordered list for the ingredients section -->
    <h2>Ingredients (A.K.A. The Magic Stuff)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened (like your feelings after a long bath)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar (a.k.a. white sweet dust)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar (don't be afraid to really squish it in there!)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (the fancy stuff that makes it smell amazing)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs (the ovoid champions of baking)</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (because cookie magic needs structure)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda (the puffy power)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (just a pinch to balance out the sweet madness)</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips (or as many as your heart tells you to add)</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped nuts (optional, but adds a little crunch - you do you)</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Task 1: Ordered list for the steps section -->
    <h2>Steps (Follow These or Get Cookie Chaos!)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F (190&deg;C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats (like armor for your baking trays).</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy (think "clouds of happiness").</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition (like you're cheering each one on!).</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined (don't overdo it, we want happy dough, not sad dough!).</li>
        <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until they're having a party in the dough.</li>
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart (social distancing, cookie style).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown (like a sun-kissed cookie dream).</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely (if you can wait that long!).</li>
    </ol>
